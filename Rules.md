Unify is a language that is supposed to be readable and understandable from the get go
we want a language that makes sense and not assumptions from the get go.


### Example
- It makes sense to end declarations and start a body rather than leaving it to a new line to decide what comes next
```
$a  = 12;
Int b = 12;

/* $ starts a declaration variable creation.
thus it is reasonable for it to be able 
to create more variables like below
*/

$b = 12, c = 30;
```

### Example 2
- Try to always stick to your rules.
